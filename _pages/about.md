Hi, I’m Zhengyu Sun (孙正宇 in Chinese), a first-year M.Eng. student at [Visualization and Intelligent Data Analytics Lab (VIDA Lab)](https://vida-lab.org/) within the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by [Prof. Yong Wang](https://yong-wang.org/). My research interest is about Data Visualization and Human-Computer Interaction.

Previously, I received my Bachelor’s degree in the School of Software from Shandong University in Jinan (2025). During that journey, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant in Intelligent Media Research Center (iLearn), focus on low-level vision.

I'm passionate about working alongside outgoing people to create meaningful projects that can improve people's lives. Welcome to discuss with me about interesting ideas, software development, or anything you want!

In my spare time, I enjoy walking outdoors and playing badminton. Oh, I really want to learn swimming during my journey in Singapore.
